Schematic illustrating the approach to analyzing the occurrence of non-
stationary solutions as a function of the selected parameter. In the example shown,
the system is controlled by two parameters p1 and p2 with reference values pâˆ—
1,2. The two-dimensional parameter space is divided into perturbation intervals I0, I1, I2, I3
over the axis of the selected parameter p1, panel a. Simulations with parameters p1,
p2 leading to non-stationary solutions (green circles) and stationary solutions (black
crosses) are shown as division into slices, panel a. In the histogram in panel b, the
corresponding fraction F of the non-stationary solutions in the total solutions, which
depends only on the variability of p1, is shown as solid horizontal lines oscillating
around 50% in this example.
